A bash script is a series of commands written in a file.
These are read and exectued by the bash program, whereby the program executes line by line.

For example, you can navigate to a certain path, create a folder and spawn a process inside it using the command line.

By naming conventions, bash scripts end with a .sh. 
However, bash scripts can run perfectly fine without the sh extension.

Scripts start with a bash bang. Scripts are also identified with a shebang. 
Shebang is a combination of bash #! followed the the bash shell path. 
This is the first line of the script. Shebang tells the shell to execute it via bash shell. 
Shebang is simply an absolute path to the bash interpreter.

Below is an example of the shebang statement.

#! /bin/bash


You can run the script in the following ways:
./hello.world.sh
bash hello.world.sh
